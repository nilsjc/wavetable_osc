wave 4550 is an wavetable oscillator based on PIC4550 8-bit mcu.
It was built in 2011 i guess, maybe earlier. 
The prototype never reach finished state.
Some ideas that never took place was USB support for uploading wavetable data, exponential control and CV inputs and more.
Note, though, that this version does indeed have CV inputs for frequency and wave pots.
The .hex file is the raw data. The original C code is lost.
As for now, in this state, the oscillator contains of one modulation and main oscillator with wavetables.
It also contains a simple sequencer.
